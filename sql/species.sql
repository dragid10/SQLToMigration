(TECHNOLOGY/MATERIAL): \"I have observed that Hemp grows naturally in that Country, and that they make Tarr and Pitch toward the Sea-Coast\" (Thwaites 1903:212, Hennepin 1698); 5. TECHNOLOGY: cordage for fishing nets made from nettles and wild hemp. The women gather, spin and twist lengths of cordage on their bare thighs. The cords used to draw these nets are made of the bark of basswood or leather. With these nets many fish and beaver are captured. They also fish with still lines [possibly of the same cordage material] (Raudot 1904:Letter 41, secondary source for Deliette 1721); 6. MATERIAL: name for Lacrosse is \'asahpa tawaani\' meaning \'net stick\', where the word for net is the same as the word for dogbane, since the net was made from dogbane or similar fiberous material (Interview with George Strack, MTO Language Camp, Longhouse, Miami, OK, 6/1/04); 7. MATERIAL: there are three Miami items made of \'hemp\', possibly dogbane or nettles, including a sack, medicine pouch and necklace cordage, all housed at the National Museum of the American Indian, in Washington D.C. (see attachment, NMAI items); 8. (MATERIAL/TECHNOLOGY): there are 2 items that are possibly made with plant fibers, which could include dogbane, nettles or basswood, among others, at the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan (see attachment, Cranbrook items);', NULL, '1.

A plant called \'sinew weed\' was used to make thread. \"It grew here [northeastern Oklahoma] and after peeling the bark the body of the weed could be separated into very fine threads which are very strong and durable. The bark is white and the plant grows about two feet high.\" (Interview with Edward Peckham, Burns 1938); 3. Both Apocynum androsaemifolium, dogbane, and A. cannabinum, Indian hemp, were probably used indiscrimminately for fibers. Pieces of fabric attributed to the Hopewell and Adena culture of Ohio were made using Apocynum fibers and a fish net was made by the Nanticoke. Older specimens have less processed fibers, whereas more recent Indian material is well broken down with fine fibers for thread or cordage (Whitford 1941); 4. Dried rhizome and roots, in doses of 0.3-1.2 gm may be used similarly to digitalis, in weakness of heart and artery strength. Dangers in its use are its irritation to the gastrointestinal tract and potential of cumulative action (Coulter 1932, Published by Eli Lilly &Co.); 5. Indian hemp grew abundantly in the Miami-Illinois country: \"There are meadows ten or twenty leagues broad, encompass\'d with fine forests, behind which are other meadows, in which grass grows six foot high. Hemp grows naturally in all that country\" (Joliet 1674:187, from Thwaites); 6. Indian hemp grew abundantly in the Miami-Illinois country: \"There is the best hemp in that country I have seen any where, though it grows naturally without any culture\" (Thwaites 1903:627, from La Salle 1674:190); 7. There is a place on the Wabash River where there is an old fish weir still visible, probably from the old Miamis (Interview with Gary Shoemaker, 2004). Fish nets, possibly made of dogbane fibers, were used at the mouth of these weirs (000). Lamoine Marks told Rafert (1989) that before the commercial nets basket nets were made from bark, mostly the inner bark of the slippery elm, or red elm, and these were used at the weirs (Interview with Lamoine Marks, Rafert 1989:47); 8. In old times, according to Lamoine Marks, Miami fishermen used fishnets and baskets to catch fish (Interview with Lamoine Marks, Rafert 1989:29, 2ndy source, original unknown); 9. In more modern times Miami fishermen [like Charlie Marks, 1870-1946, Lamoine\'s father) used commercial seine nets and spears (Interview with Lamoine Marks, Rafert 1989:29); 10. An ancient fishing weir dam still exists on the Wabash River, northeast of Peru, Indiana and was and is known to most Miami fishermen. Lamoine Marks was told about it when he was a boy, by his father Charlie, and last saw it while fishing in winter in 1953.  Rafert and Marks rediscovered it in July, 1988.

She also picked a very young dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum) shoot and said it was a \'milkweed\' and was eaten as greens (author\'s note: This species has narrower leaves, not necessarily fuzzier, but has milky sap and looks very similar to common milkweed shoots--it may have been called a \'milkweed\' at this stage due to its similar look, milky sap, and purposes identical to common milkweed) (Interview with Mildred Walker, 2004); 6. Dani Tippman and her mother Mary (Strack) Swenda harvest the top four leaves of taller plants, or plants of any stage of growth and cook them as greens. \"The four leaves represent the four directions, \" said Mary.

She has noticed the stems kept growing and flowered after tops removed for eating (Interview with Dani Tippman and Mary (Strack) Swenda, 2005); 7. Dani Tippman learned from her mother, Mary (Strack) Swenda, to harvest one out of every four milkweed stems (Interview with Dani Tippman, 2004); 8. A milkweed harvesting trip was part of the language camp in June 2004, when the milkweed had both young shoots and taller stems for harvest. Mildred Walker, Howard Walker, Daryl Baldwin and many other tribal members participated in this late spring harvesting (Aatotankiki myaamiaki 2004 7(2):6);', '1. Cases of poisoning have been recorded from livestock feeding on leaves and stems, but usually these plants remain untouched in pastures (Steyermark 1962); 2.

The area around Miami, OK and KS, at the time of Miami relocation was all tallgrass prairie, where the buffalo and fire kept the forest limited to river bottoms. The buffalo only went through a particular area about once a year, probably following early spring shoots of prairie plants north as spring progressed.

They considered the small shoots, or \'pups\' of this species to be poisonous. (Dunn ca. 1900); 9. Fibers from the common milkweed were widely used by most tribes within the plant\'s geographic distribution. Objects were made in part of whole using common milkweed fibers, including a Sauk and Fox bag, a Delaware drum string, a Kickapoo ball of string and a fish net by the prehistoric cave and rock-shelter dwellers of Ohio (Whitford 1941); 8. Dried roots of Asclepias tuberosa (Butterfly milkweed) in small doses (1-3 gm) reduces arterial tension by depressing heart action and causes diaphoresis (000?) and increases diuresis (000?). It is also an expectorant, and be a slight tonic, mild laxative, carminative (000?), diuretic, and an emetic in large doses (Coulter 1932:10, Published by Eli Lilly & Co.); 9. Young shoots of other milkweed species have been noted as food of Canadian Indians, beginning as early as the 18th century. Use of young flower buds and pods as food by Native Americans in recent times has also been documented for the Zuni, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Rio Grande Pueblo at Jemez, Tarahumar, Tewa, Kiowa, White Mountain Apache and Hopi. Often, pods were cooked with meat, in an attempt to soften the meat by action of a compound in the pods that caused tenderizing. There are some reports of Native American groups eating butterfly milkweed, Asclepias tuberosa, tubers, although these are treated by contemporary researchers as poisonous. Numerous species were used by numerous tribes for the bast (stem) fibers for cordage, ropes, basketry and netting in historic times. (Cheatam et al. 1995:30-33); 10.

The Miami Tribe\'s Tahway Farms has pecan groves and the pecans are part of a traditional, healthy, diet of the Miami and other Native Americans living in the native range of the pecan.

CUSTOMS: used to keep storm away. \"Also when storm is coming, put a pinch in the fire, or by the door to keep storm away\" (Dunn ca. 1900);  3. CUSTOMS: Funerals. Prior to the body being taken to the cemetary, an elder or the Chief goes to the cemetery to smoke the ground with cedar and tobacco. The cedar is evergreen, and signifies continuing life and the tobacco helps prayers ascend to the Great Spirit (Dunn 1919, Aatotankiki Myaamiaki, 3(1):3, 2000);  4. CUSTOMS: If the ceremony is performed at the gravesite then the leader will cast cedar to the four directions and into the grave and over the coffin. After the ceremony friends and family gather at a relatives house. If the deceased smoked cigarettes, relatives will place cigarettes in containers around the area and each person should smoke one of the cigarettes as an honoring. Accompanying this is a smoking ceremony where cedar cedar and tobacco are placed in a receptable and left to smolder. The smoke is fanned over a person in a manner similar to washing, the purpose being to cleanse away the spirit of death (Interview with Chief Floyd Leonard, Aatotankiki Myaamiaki, 3(1):4, 2000); 5.

If he accepts and smokes the sign is held good and the ambassador immediately commences to propose the arrangements for a peace. But if he refuses to smoke at all, it is totally unnecessary to attempt any thing and me makes the best of his way home.\" (Trowbridge 1825, from Kinietz 1938:27); 7. CUSTOMS: peace-making ceremony involves dancing who are chosen by the warriors of the recent battle. Warriors take turns standing up, recounting great feats of bravery during battle, and choose a dancer by striking a pipe stem or piece of tobacco or a knife against a pole in the ground (Trowbridge 1825, from Kinietz 1938:28-29); 8. CUSTOMS: used to make an offering to the deity that inhabits unusual rock formations, mountains or upon entering caves, as they are passed in travels. \"It is not an uncommon thing for an Indian to lay upon a large stone a quantity of tobacco, and then to address it -- \"O Stone, you are fond of tobacco and I here give you a little to smoke--I am fond of life, I like to stay inthis world and I hope you will let me remain, and that you will give me success in hunting and travelling.\" (Trowbridge 1825, from Kinietz 1938:56); 9. CUSTOMS: show repect to elders. \"Often the young men take to the aged the finest part of a deer which they have killed, or a skin, some tobacco, or moccasins.\" (Trowbridge 1825, from Kinietz 1938:57); 10. CUSTOMS: offered to the Manitou, the spirits. \"There is a common Tradition amongst that People [the Illinois] That a great number of Miami\'s were drown\'d in that Place [a place just above the city of Alton, Illinois, where there are a great number of animal figures painted on a steep rock face with red paint], being pursu\'d by the Savages of Matfigamea [an Algonquian tribe living near the mouth of the St. Francis River in Arkansas, which later became part of the Kaskaskia]; and since that time, the Savages going by the Rock, use to smoak, and offer Tobacco to those Beasts, to appease, as they say, the Manitou, that is, in the Language of the Algonq', '1. A small variety of tobacco that was cultivated in the area of the Maumee River was used for ceremonies and offerings (Aatotankiki Myaamiaki, 5(3):2, 2002, Rogers); 2. Tobacco branches/leaves were cut with a knife (Gravier ca.1700:255.22, translation from French to English by Masthay/Suter); 3. The tobacco was cut, or picked by plucking the leaves off. \"We pluck, thin out the tobacco,\" \"I pick it, cut it,\" \"I pluck the leaves off it\" (Costa 2004, St. Jerome ca.1692; \"nipapak8namina. nichikai8namina\", \"nipakich8a,\" \"i8chi nimarirena michipak8ki,\" translation from French to English by Costa); 4. Tobacco is cultivated by past and present Miamis. A strain called Mecsuki Tobacco was being grown at the Longhouse in 1996. Cultivation involves the following steps: The crop is started in February, in planters with potting soil. Seeds are sprinkled over the surface of the soil and can be mixed with sand prior to sprinkling. Seeds are pushed into soil one half an inch deep and watered once. Remove weaker, smaller seedlings as seeds germinate and grow. In mid April after the final frost transplant outside about one foot apart and water moderately. Plants grow to five or six feet high. In July the plants will bloom. When seed capsules are present, cut off top of plant and dry for planting next year. Then, harvest the rest of the plant, roll the leaves up and tie with twine to keep them rolled, and hand leaves for drying. Finally, shred leaves and smoke (Interviews with Miami Tribal elders by Dr. Hamill\'s students, Miami, OK, 1996, MTO Archives); 5. Tobacco was transplanted by hand in the early days. \"I put [it] standing in the ground, transplant some tobacco\" (Gravier ca.1700:319.04, \"nimamara acema8a\", \"je mets debout en terre, transplante du tabac,\" translation from French to English by Masthay000); 6. Charlevoix mentions a native tobacco that is far inferior in taste to the introduced tobacco. Kellogg adds that the tribes of the Great Lakes used a species of native tobacco, not a true tobacco, called \"petun\" and a tobacco mixture containing herbs, sumac, dogwood, and cornel [?] bark (Charlevoix 1682-1761:125, from Kellogg 1923:116);', NULL, '1. On the origin of tobacco: Tobacco Garden Creek was first described by Lewis and Clark, April 17th, 1805. It was actually a marsh of reeds, Phragmites communis and was misnamed by some early traveler, confusing the Sioux and Assiniboine name for reed, cedi (cheddy), and tobacco, candi (chandee), says Larpenteur. He adds, \"Of course, Indians cultivated a native tobacco (Nicotiana quadrivalvis) in those days; but not in separate gardens, apart from corn, etc.\" (Coues, 1898); 2. Keller George (Oneida) described uses and growing of tobacco (Kohn 1997); 3. The tobacco pipes were made from a red stone, now known as catlinite, joined to a hollow reed for smoking, and decorated with feather. Tobacco pipes are also known as calumets (Thwaites 1903:654, from Marquette 1673:211); 4. The calumet, or tobacco pipe, dance is described in detail in Thwaites (1903:655, from Marquette 1673:212); 5. The Miami-Illinois term \"nimikima\" translates as \"I play with him. I gather tobacco or some other animate thing\" (Gravier ca.1700:293.10, \"je joue avec luy. Je cueille du tabac ou autre chose noble,\" translation from French to English by Masthay000?); 5. Archaeological studies in central and south-central Indiana revealed that tobacco was either cultivated or \"strongly encouraged in wild stands\" during the late Woodland period (A.D. 1000 through A.D. 1450) (Bush 2003); 6. Mildred Walker recalls that althought they did not grow tobacco in her family garden in Miami, others in the community grew \"long green fat tobacco\" which was stronger than Indian tobacco (Interview with Mildred Walker, Olds, Olds and Tippman 1999); 7. Algonquian chiefs of villages can remarry as soon as six months after a wife has died, to ensure they have women to cultivate fields for tobacco and other crops. \"The chiefs of the villages are not under obligation to remain widowers after six month\' time, because they cannot get along without women to serve them, and to cultivate the lands which produce their tobacco and all [else] that is necessary for them to be prepared to receive those who come to visit them, and strangers who have any business regarding the tribe to place before them\" (Perrot 1680-1718, from Blair 1911:373-74); 8. Other terms for tobacco have been documented as \"samwah\" (Kerr 1835:133, 283 & 400, 1st Wea Primer, from Mongosa), ts (000:134-135) as \"saamau\", and by Hockett(1938, from Peoria, spelling cannot be reproduced here); 9.

They make two kinds. That which they roast gives them more trouble than that which they boil, for they have to make large griddles and exercise particular care to turn the ears from time to time to prevent their burning too much on one side, and afterwards they have to shell off the kernels. They therefore make very little of this kind. The kind which they boil they gather just as tender as the corn for roasting, and with shells, which they find more convenient than knives, they cut all the kernels, throwing away the cobs, until they have about the quantity they wish to cook for that day. They never keep any for the next day because of the excessive care needed to prevent it from turning sour. After this, as soon as it has boiled for a few minutes, they spread it on reed mats, which they also make in the same manner as those that serve for their cabins. The drying process usually takes two days. They make a great store of this kind. As regards the large ears which are ripe at the end of August, after they have gathered it they husk the ears and spread them on mats. In the evening they gather them into a heap and cover them well, when the sun has risen they spread them again, and they keep this up for a week, then they thresh it with big sticks six or seven feet long, in a place which they surround with matting to prevent the flying kernels from getting lost (Pease 1934:343-344, Deliette 1721, \"Pour revenir aux occupations des femmes, a la fin de juillet elles commencent a faire mesler ou secher du bled, elles en font de deux manieres, celuy quelles font Rostir leurs donne plus de peine que celuy quelles sont bouillir, car il faut quelles fassent de un soin rands Grils, et quelles ayent tout particulier de retourner de temps en temps, les espics crainte qu\'ils ne se bruslent trop d\'un coste, et apres il faut qu\'elle l\'egraine c\'est pourquoy elles en font tres peu, celuy qu\'elles font bouillir elles le cueillent aussi tendre que celuy quelles font rostir, et avec des Coquilles qui leurs sont plus commodes que des couteaux elles coupent tous les grains, jetant le conston jusqu\'a ce qu\'elles en ayent la quantite a peu pres qu\'elles en veulent faire cuire dans la meme journee, elles n\'en gardent jamais pour le Lendemain, a cause du trop grand soin qu\'il faudroit prendre pour l\'empescher d\'airgrir, apres quoysitot qu\'il a bouilly un demy quart d\'heure, elles l\'etendent sur des nattes de jonc qu\'elles font aussi de la meme maniere, que ceux don??t elles se servent pour leurs Cabanes, Il faut ordinairement deux jours pour le faire secher, ils en font de grosses provisions.

Corn preparation: The Delaware would bring the corn in by the wagon loads, and drop it into boiling water for about three minutes, then dumped onto clean wagon sheets and husked and cut by young folks. They would take a spoon and with the handle down, press down right between the rows, resulting in whole kernel corn. They would do this all day long, and if the got a whole row out without it breaking, then they got to go around and get a kiss from whoever we wanted. The Delawares did it differently, cutting their corn and then scraping the cob, as did the Potawatomies, but just for certain dishes.The regular everyday corn was always whole kernel (Kohn 1997: Joanna J. Nichol, Elder, Delaware Tribe of Indians); 6.

Women helped tend the corn, which could be used as a focus of attack of enemy tribes: \"Several women complained that their corn had been cut, and others that they had found Iroquois moccasins in their fields. . . .if it was true, as their women said, that enemies had cut their corn, they would surprise the enemy scouts, who doubtless were waiting for the crop to ripen before attacking them.

It is much like our European oats; the stem is knotted, and grows about two foot above the surface of the water. The corn is not bigger than ours, but it is twice as long, and therefore it yields much more meal. It grows above the water in June, and the savages gather it about September in this manner: They go in their canows into those rivers, and as they go they shake the ears of corn in their canows, which easily falls, if it be ripe: They dry it upon the fire; and when it is very dry, they put it into a kind of sack made with the skin of beasts; and having made a hole in the ground, they put their sack therein, and tread on it till they see the chaff is separated from the corn, which they winnow afterwards. They pound it in a mortar to reduce it into meal, or else boil it in water, and season it with grease, which makes it near as good as our rice\" (Joliet 1674:196-197, from Thwaites 1903:636-637; also described by Marquette 1674, from Kenton 1925:336); 3.
